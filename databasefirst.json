According to Electrive, the U5 is 4.70 meters long with a 140 kW motor driving the front wheels. Range is said to be 460 kilometers | 286 miles in the discredited NEDC test cycle. Expect real world range of about 240 miles | 386 km once all the conversions are done.Prices have not yet been announced but rumors in the European media hit of a base price of about €25,000. If that is true, Aiways can expect quite a few customers queuing up to buy a U5.  The company says it expects to being selling the U5 next year beginning in Norway before expanding sales to Sweden and Germany.",

        "description": "Centuries ago, mankind was slaughtered to near extinction by monstrous humanoid creatures called titans, forcing humans to hide in fear behind enormous concentric walls. What makes these giants truly terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger but what appears to be out of pleasure. To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began living within defensive barriers, resulting in one hundred years without a single titan encounter. However, that fragile calm is soon shattered when a colossal titan manages to breach the supposedly impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival against the man-eating abominations.",

        "description": "At the Mono’s heart is a solidly mounted engine, a 280bhp 2.3-litre four-cylinder Cosworth unit to be precise. It sits in the middle (as you’d expect), driving the rear wheels via a six-speed Hewland sequential gearbox and a limited-slip differential. The 0-60 time is well below 3.0sec while the top speed is a claimed 170mph. Its 527bhp/ton power-to-weight ratio is 6bhp better than a Bugatti Veyron's, too.The suspension comprises a racing-style fully adjustable pushrod setup, the brakes come from AP Racing and the Kumho tyres are bespoke-developed for the Mono. Ultimately grabbing the headlines, though, is the Sebastian Vettel cockpit view, with a central, single seat (each customer has their interior fitted around them, as you might hope at this sort of money) and an electronic, button-festooned steering wheel with a flat bottom and top. It’s pure theatre.",

        "description": "Honda revealed the updated 2020 Civic Type R on Thursday at the Tokyo Auto Salon.The look inside and out is slightly revised, but Honda also gave the Civic Type R performance upgrades that we hope will improve an already great track car.Those improvements include revised front suspension settings to reduce friction and improve steering feel, new dampers for a more comfortable ride, and stiffer bushings that Honda says will improve grip. New two-piece rotors and different brake pads are meant to improve high-speed braking and reduce fade. The 6-speed manual transmission has shorter throws between gears and a new shift knob. A larger front grille also improves engine cooling but doesn't increase output of the 2.0-liter turbo-4 from the current car's 306 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque.Honda says additional information about the U.S.-spec Civic Type R will be announced closer to the car's release later this year. Honda did not give any information on prices, though the brand increased prices at least twice for the 2019 model to the current $37,255.",
