        "description": "Centuries ago, mankind was slaughtered to near extinction by monstrous humanoid creatures called titans, forcing humans to hide in fear behind enormous concentric walls. What makes these giants truly terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger but what appears to be out of pleasure. To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began living within defensive barriers, resulting in one hundred years without a single titan encounter. However, that fragile calm is soon shattered when a colossal titan manages to breach the supposedly impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival against the man-eating abominations.",

        "description": "Honda revealed the updated 2020 Civic Type R on Thursday at the Tokyo Auto Salon.The look inside and out is slightly revised, but Honda also gave the Civic Type R performance upgrades that we hope will improve an already great track car.Those improvements include revised front suspension settings to reduce friction and improve steering feel, new dampers for a more comfortable ride, and stiffer bushings that Honda says will improve grip. New two-piece rotors and different brake pads are meant to improve high-speed braking and reduce fade. The 6-speed manual transmission has shorter throws between gears and a new shift knob. A larger front grille also improves engine cooling but doesn't increase output of the 2.0-liter turbo-4 from the current car's 306 horsepower and 295 lb-ft of torque.Honda says additional information about the U.S.-spec Civic Type R will be announced closer to the car's release later this year. Honda did not give any information on prices, though the brand increased prices at least twice for the 2019 model to the current $37,255.",
